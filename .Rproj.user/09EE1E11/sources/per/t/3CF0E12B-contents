I am a 3rd year PhD student in the {{< staticref "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-alfano/c-alfano.github.io/main/uploads/CV.pdf" "newtab" >}}Department of Statistics{{< /staticref >}} at the University of Oxford, under the supervision of {{< staticref "https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~rebeschi/" "newtab" >}}Patrick Rebeschini{{< /staticref >}} and {{< staticref "https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~deligian/" "newtab" >}}George Deligiannidis.{{< /staticref >}} I am funded by EPSRC.

My research interests include reinforcement learning, optimization and learning theory. In particular, I focus on building and analysing reinforcement learning algorithms using standard optimization tools, such as natural gradient descent and mirror descent.
